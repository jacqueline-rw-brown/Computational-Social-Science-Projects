    "The above graphs shows the proportion of Black or African American, Native American, and Hispanic/Latinx residents by region. We see that the South and Southeast have the highest proportion of Black residents, while the West has the highest proportion of Native residents. Hispanic residents are the most balanced across region, but are more densely populated in the West and the South regions. Given that these groups are more disposed to type 2 diabetes (according to the CDC), it's likely that regions with a higher concentration of these groups could be associated with an increased rate of diabetes.

    "The above plot shows the rate of physical inactivity by region. Interestingly, the region with the highest obesity rate (the West) has the lowest inactivity rate. However, the West does tend to have a culture of outdoor activity in certain areas and milder winter weather. That being said, rates of inactivity are relatively similar among counties - the median physical inactivity rate of all regions is fairly close (with the West as an exception). I would have expected the rate of physical inactivity to track the obesity rate. "

    "**MODEL DESCRIPTIONS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I am using OLS, Ridge, and LASSO regression. OLS estimates coeffients in a linear fassion by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the dependent variale and the independent variable (i.e. least squares). This model is the simplest of the three, but is ideal in the case where the relationship between dependent and independent variable is expected to be linear. However, if the relationship between variables isn't linear, this model is not ideal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression is a shrinkage model which seeks coefficients that fit the data well and minimize the residual sum of squares. The shrinkage penalty (tuning parameter) shrinks beta estimates toward zero. The advantage of Ridge over OLS is rooted in the bias-variance tradeoff: as the tuning parameter increases, the variance decreases (though bias increases). However, when the OLS model has high variance, Ridge can be the best fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "LASSO is similar to ridge regression in that it is a shrinkage model, but unlike ridge, forces some coefficients to be zero when the tuning parameter is large enough. LASSO produces sparse models that only include a subset of variables. LASSO also tries to minimize RSS, and as lamda increases the variance decreases but the bias increases. Between ridge and LASSO, LASSO is ideal when a small number of features have large coefficients, and most features have small coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, where a few features likely predict much of the variation (obsesity rate, physical inactivity rate), I'd predict that LASSO would be best. However, given that the relationship (at least between obesity and diabetes rates) appears to be somewhat linear, all three models are appropriate to evaluate. "

    "The bias-variance has to do with overfitting. Models with more of the data included in the training set, or more complex models, have lower bias because the model is well fit to the data. However, in these cases there is higher variance as the model may not be able to predict the outcome variable well on the test set if it is overfitted to the training data. However, in more flexible (less complex) models, bias can increase and the model may not have actually identified the key relationships affecting the outcome variable. \n",

However, we want to ensure that the model is capturing which features are related to the outcome variable. Particularly in the case of health outcomes, it's important to identify the most at-risk counties to improve policy and prevent future illness. "

    "The LASSO model did well on the training and the test data, with similar RMSE values for both. The r-squared was also similar, at about .5 (.44 for the test set). The model explains about half of the variation in the data. In a visualization of the non-zero model coefficients, we see that -- aligned with CDC info on diabetes risk factors -- obesity rate, physical inactivity rate, age (45+ but moreso for ages 65+), and certain racial identities are more associated with diabetes rates. The model eliminated region variables, which makes sense given that region is associated with these other characteristics but does not directly affect diabetes. However, the exploratory data analysis showed that the West and the South had highest rates of obesity, and the Southeast and the South had highest rates of physical inactivity. Ultimately, I would likely use the diabetes predictions to identify which counties to prioritize in the pilot program, rather than using another model that didn't zero out the region variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, I would consider deploying a version of this model in the real-world. While the algorithm's predictions aren't completely accurate, the risk of a \"false positive\" (inaccurate prediction that is too high) is low: investing resources in diabetes prevention into a county that has a lower baseline diabetes rate would still lower diabetes rates among those with diabetes, which is good. While a false negative (inaccurate prediction that is too low) would mean a county isn't getting resources it needs to combat diabetes, I would assume algorithm use is accompanied by data analysis on diabetes trends over time. In that case, the pilot program would be able to catch counties that fell through the \"cracks\" of the algorithm and who need additional resources. However, given that the model has similar fit across the test and train data, and aligns with CDC's medical guidance on diabetes, it seems to be accurate and has a low risk of doing harm."
