    "The above graphs shows the proportion of Black or African American, Native American, and Hispanic/Latinx residents by region. We see that the South and Southeast have the highest proportion of Black residents, while the West has the highest proportion of Native residents. Hispanic residents are the most balanced across region, but are more densely populated in the West and the South regions. Given that these groups are more disposed to type 2 diabetes (according to the CDC), it's likely that regions with a higher concentration of these groups could be associated with an increased rate of diabetes.

    "The above plot shows the rate of physical inactivity by region. Interestingly, the region with the highest obesity rate (the West) has the lowest inactivity rate. However, the West does tend to have a culture of outdoor activity in certain areas and milder winter weather. That being said, rates of inactivity are relatively similar among counties - the median physical inactivity rate of all regions is fairly close (with the West as an exception). I would have expected the rate of physical inactivity to track the obesity rate. "

    "The bias-variance has to do with overfitting. Models with more of the data included in the training set, or more complex models, have lower bias because the model is well fit to the data. However, in these cases there is higher variance as the model may not be able to predict the outcome variable well on the test set if it is overfitted to the training data. However, in more flexible (less complex) models, bias can increase and the model may not have actually identified the key relationships affecting the outcome variable. \n",

There is of course a desire to have the best fit model possible, but that comes with the tradeoff of more variance in predictions on test data (and future prediction data). However, we want to ensure that the model is capturing which features are related to the outcome variable. Particularly in the case of health outcomes, it's important to identify the most at-risk counties to improve policy and prevent future illness. "

    "The LASSO model did well on the training and the test data, with similar RMSE values for both. The r-squared was also similar, at about .5 (.44 for the test set). The model explains about half of the variation in the data. In a visualization of the non-zero model coefficients, we see that -- aligned with CDC info on diabetes risk factors -- obesity rate, physical inactivity rate, age (45+ but moreso for ages 65+), and certain racial identities are more associated with diabetes rates. The model eliminated region variables, which makes sense given that region is associated with these other characteristics but does not directly affect diabetes. However, the exploratory data analysis showed that the West and the South had highest rates of obesity, and the Southeast and the South had highest rates of physical inactivity. I would prioritize these regions, but more specifically look at the obesity rates and physical inactivity rates of specific counties to target in the piltot program. After that, I would look at the proportion of Black residents and the proportion of residents over age 65 for additional consideration in the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, I would consider deploying a version of this model in the real-world. While the algorithm's predictions aren't completely accurate, the risk of a \"false positive\" (inaccurate prediction that is too high) is low: investing resources in diabetes prevention into a county that has a lower baseline diabetes rate would still lower diabetes rates among those with diabetes, which is good. While a false negative (inaccurate prediction that is too low) would mean a county isn't getting resources it needs to combat diabetes, I would assume algorithm use is accompanied by data analysis on diabetes trends over time. In that case, the pilot program would be able to catch counties that fell through the \"cracks\" of the algorithm and who need additional resources. However, given that the model has similar fit across the test and train data, and aligns with CDC's medical guidance on diabetes, it seems to be accurate and has a low risk of doing harm."
